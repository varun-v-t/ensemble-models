# Ensemble Models Cheatsheet
This notebook explains how different Ensemble techniques can be implemented in python. 

## What is an ensemble method?
Ensemble models in machine learning combine the decisions from multiple models to improve the overall performance.

## Types of Model implemented
1. Simple Ensemble Technique
  - Max Voting
  - Averaging
  - Weighted Average
2. Advanced Ensemble techniques
  - Stacking
  - Blending
  - Bagging
  - Boosting

## Algorithms based on Bagging and Boosting
- Bagging meta-estimator
- Random Forest
- AdaBoost
- Gradient Boosting (GBM)
- XGBoost
- Light GBM
- CatBoost
